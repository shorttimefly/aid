 * is published to npm and the pin here is bumped, referencing
 * `SystemCapabilities.READ_AUDIT_LOG` directly breaks `tsc` against the
 * currently-pinned `^0.0.52`. The value is byte-identical to what the upstream
 * constant will resolve to post-publish; drop this constant in a one-line
 * follow-up once the data-schemas pin moves to `^0.0.53`.

 * dep is pinned to `data-schemas@0.0.52` (which predates the category entry).
 * Without this, only seeded admins could ever hold the capability — the
 * grants `CapabilityPanel` had no row to toggle.
 *
 * Drops to a no-op once `0.0.53+` is pinned because the upstream array already
 * contains `READ_AUDIT_LOG`; the dedupe pass below keeps it safe to keep
 * shipped until the shim itself is removed.
